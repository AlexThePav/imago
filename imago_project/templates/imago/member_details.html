<p>Therefore, we must give you a test. Don't say that word. I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Nee cannot hear. Firstly, you must find... another shrubbery! [dramatic chord] He said the word again! No, not 'is' -- we couldn't get vary far in life not saying 'is'. Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring! [dramatic chord] Shh shh. We are now the Knights Who Say Ecky-ecky-ecky- ecky-pikang-zoom-boing-mumble-mumble. Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get a two-level effect with a little path running down the middle. It is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly. But there is one small problem.</p>
